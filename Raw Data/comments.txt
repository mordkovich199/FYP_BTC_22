1) SP500 price is missing for weekends. I suggest simply extrapolating end of week price to weekends to make it consistent with bitcoin
2) I can't think of any particular algorithm to check whether sometimes days are missed in other data sources too, however one thing we could do is select a specific date as a start in all datasets, then look at the length of the dataset.
3) The btc supply file literally only has the stock value. Calculate in other columns several alternative metrics for flow now. You will most likely experiment with several alternatives when training a model.

Next Steps:

1. Download all Artem's metrics as well.
2. Recalibrate all datasets - i.e. start and end with the same date
3. Calculate z-scores of all metrics
4. Write a function that automaticall recalibrate datasets based on input and returns z-score values all in one .csv file + the new start and end date
